# AnalogJS Pt1. What is a meta-framework??

2024-10-10

![analog.svg](../../../../public/analog.svg)

Analog.js is a meta-framework for Angular (think next.js/nuxt.js/sveltekit)
created by [Brandon Roberts](https://x.com/brandontroberts) (maintainer of ngrx).

**NOTE:** this will mainly be a reprint of my analog talk in April 2024.
I've updated what I felt necessary.

<br>

## What is a meta framework?

A framework built on top of another framework?

_Okay??? Why?_

You can do cool ~~stuff~~ like file based routing and analog single file
components (sfc)

You may have heard of Next.js, SvelteKit, and Nuxt.

_Nice_

<br>

## So why Analog?

Angular is dope, why not make it better?

Honestly tho

- File based routing
- Content routes (markdown routes)
- API / Server routes / server side data fetching
- Hybrid server side rendering / static site generation
- .analog component authoring
