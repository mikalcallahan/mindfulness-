## de tristesse

Tides wash us away like shore break on that sunny day

I slept on you and watched the clouds dance in the back of my mind

a beautiful display of imagery, tangled love in a mystery,

just a little too afraid to show it.

I lost myself in you and found nothing but emptiness

for one must be so enamored in oneself that they are respecting and doing what they know they aught to at all times.

I grew needy and weak, that’s why the depression set in and I lost it.

I’ve got it back and I don’t need you, a blunt and some meditation help me keep true

~~I wish that I could be~~

~~Your first thought in the morning~~

I no longer wish

To be your first thought in the morning
